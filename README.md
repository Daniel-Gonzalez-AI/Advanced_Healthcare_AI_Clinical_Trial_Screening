# üè• Clinical Trial Screening AI

*Advanced Healthcare AI System for Patient Eligibility Assessment*

## üéØ Project Overview

This advanced AI system demonstrates sophisticated natural language processing capabilities for healthcare applications. It uses state-of-the-art clinical language models to automatically screen patients for clinical trial eligibility based on their medical records and trial criteria.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**: This is a research demonstration using synthetic data only. This system is not intended for actual clinical use and has not been validated by medical professionals or regulatory authorities.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Advanced Clinical NLP**: Utilizes specialized clinical BERT models (BioBERT, ClinicalBERT)
- **Text-Pair Classification**: Sophisticated reasoning between patient profiles and trial criteria
- **Interpretable Results**: Attention visualization showing decision factors
- **Bias Detection**: Comprehensive fairness evaluation across demographics
- **Real-time Processing**: Fast inference for interactive demonstrations
- **Synthetic Data**: Safe demonstration using completely artificial patient data

## üé® How to Use the Demo

1. **Enter Patient Information**: Add synthetic clinical notes in the patient text area
2. **Specify Trial Criteria**: Input the eligibility requirements for the clinical trial
3. **Get Screening Results**: View eligibility decision with confidence score
4. **Explore Reasoning**: Examine attention visualizations to understand the AI's decision process

### Example Patient Profile
```
Patient: 45-year-old female with Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 3 years ago.
Current medications: Metformin 1000mg twice daily, Lisinopril 10mg daily.
HbA1c: 7.2% (last measured 2 months ago).
Blood pressure: 135/85 mmHg.
No history of cardiovascular events.
BMI: 28.5 kg/m¬≤.
```

### Example Trial Criteria
```
Inclusion Criteria:
- Adults aged 18-65 years
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosis
- HbA1c between 7.0% and 10.0%
- BMI 25-35 kg/m¬≤

Exclusion Criteria:
- History of cardiovascular events
- Current insulin therapy
- Pregnancy or nursing
```

## üß† Technical Architecture

### Model Pipeline
- **Base Model**: Clinical BERT variants (BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, PubMedBERT)
- **Task**: Binary text-pair classification (eligible/not eligible)
- **Input Processing**: Tokenized patient-criteria pairs with attention masking
- **Output**: Probability scores with confidence intervals

### Key Components
1. **Text Preprocessing**: Clinical text normalization and standardization
2. **Model Inference**: BERT-based text-pair classification
3. **Result Interpretation**: Attention visualization and reasoning extraction
4. **Bias Monitoring**: Fairness metrics across demographic groups

### Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: >85% on synthetic test data
- **Precision**: >90% (minimizing false positives)
- **Recall**: >80% (minimizing missed eligible patients)
- **Inference Speed**: <2 seconds per screening

## üìä Dataset Information

This project uses the `Kevinkrs/TrialLlama-datasets` dataset, enhanced with:
