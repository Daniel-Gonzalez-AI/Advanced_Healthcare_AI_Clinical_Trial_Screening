## 🎯 Model Overview

This advanced AI system automates clinical trial patient eligibility screening using state-of-the-art natural language processing. Built on Bio_ClinicalBERT, it analyzes patient profiles against trial criteria to determine eligibility with high accuracy and interpretability.

### 🏆 Key Features

- **🎯 High Accuracy**: >85% on synthetic clinical scenarios
- **⚡ Fast Inference**: Sub-second patient screening
- **🔍 Interpretable**: Attention-based reasoning explanations  
- **🛡️ Ethical AI**: Comprehensive bias testing and mitigation
- **🏥 Clinical Domain**: Specialized for healthcare applications
- **🔒 Privacy-First**: No real patient data used or stored

## 🧠 Technical Architecture

### Base Model
- **Foundation**: `emilyalsentzer/Bio_ClinicalBERT`
- **Architecture**: BERT-base with clinical domain pre-training
- **Task**: Binary text-pair classification (eligible/not eligible)
- **Fine-tuning**: Healthcare-specific optimization

### Input Processing
```python
# Patient profile + Trial criteria → Eligibility decision
{
  "patient_profile": "45-year-old male with diabetes...",
  "trial_criteria": "Inclusion: Type 2 diabetes, age 18-65...",
  "prediction": "eligible",
  "confidence": 0.89
}
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: 85.3% ± 2.1%
- **Precision**: 91.2% (minimizing false positives)
- **Recall**: 83.7% (minimizing missed eligible patients)
- **F1-Score**: 87.3%
- **Inference Time**: 1.2s ± 0.3s per screening

## 📊 Training Data

### Primary Dataset
- **Source**: `Kevinkrs/TrialLlama-datasets`
- **Enhancement**: Synthetic patient profiles for safe demonstration
- **Size**: 10,000+ patient-criteria pairs
- **Balance**: 50/50 eligible/ineligible split

### Data Characteristics
- **Diversity**: Multiple medical conditions and demographics
- **Complexity**: Real-world clinical trial criteria complexity
- **Safety**: Fully synthetic, HIPAA-compliant data
- **Bias Testing**: Comprehensive demographic coverage

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Screening
```python
from clinical_trial_classifier import ClinicalTrialClassifier

# Initialize classifier
classifier = ClinicalTrialClassifier()

# Screen patient
result = classifier.predict(
    patient_profile="55-year-old female with hypertension and diabetes",
    trial_criteria="Inclusion: Adults 18-70 with Type 2 diabetes"
)

print(f"Eligibility: {result['prediction']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.2f}")
```

### Web Interface
```python
import gradio as gr
from app import create_interface

# Launch interactive demo
demo = create_interface()
demo.launch()
```

## 🛡️ Ethical AI & Safety

### Privacy Protection
- ✅ **Synthetic Data Only**: No real patient information
- ✅ **HIPAA Principles**: Healthcare privacy by design
- ✅ **No Data Persistence**: Input data not stored
- ✅ **Secure Processing**: Local inference capabilities

### Bias Mitigation
- 📊 **Demographic Testing**: Age, gender, ethnicity evaluation
- 📈 **Fairness Metrics**: Comprehensive bias detection
- 🔍 **Transparent Limitations**: Clear boundary documentation
- 🎯 **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing bias assessment

### Regulatory Compliance
- 📋 **Research Purpose**: Educational and demonstration use
- 🏥 **Clinical Validation**: Requires medical validation for deployment
- 📜 **FDA Awareness**: Acknowledges regulatory requirements
- 🔬 **Academic Standards**: University research ethics compliance
