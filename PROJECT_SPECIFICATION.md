## 📊 Data Strategy

### Primary Dataset
- **Source**: `Kevinkrs/TrialLlama-datasets`
- **Format**: Patient notes paired with trial criteria
- **Labels**: Eligible/Excluded classifications
- **Size**: Validate dataset size and quality

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline
```python
def create_text_pairs(patient_record, trial_criteria):
    """Create input pairs for the classification model."""
    # Combine patient info with trial criteria
    # Handle medical terminology normalization
    # Create structured input format
    pass

def preprocess_clinical_text(text):
    """Standardize clinical text format."""
    # Remove PHI (use synthetic data only)
    # Normalize medical abbreviations
    # Handle structured data fields
    pass
```

### Synthetic Data Generation
- Create demo patient profiles (synthetic, HIPAA-compliant)
- Generate diverse clinical scenarios
- Include edge cases for robust testing

## 🧠 Model Development Strategy

### Phase 1: Model Selection & Setup
```python
# Model options to evaluate:
models_to_test = [
    "emilyalsentzer/Bio_ClinicalBERT",
    "microsoft/BiomedNLP-PubMedBERT-base-uncased-abstract-fulltext",
    "dmis-lab/biobert-v1.1"
]
```

### Phase 2: Fine-tuning Approach
- Use HuggingFace Trainer API
- Implement class balancing for eligible/excluded samples  
- Add regularization to prevent overfitting
- Monitor validation metrics carefully

### Phase 3: Evaluation Metrics
- **Primary**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- **Clinical Focus**: Minimize false negatives (missing eligible patients)
- **Interpretability**: Attention visualization for decision reasoning
- **Robustness**: Performance across different clinical domains

## 🛡️ Ethical & Regulatory Considerations

### Data Privacy & Security
- [ ] Use only synthetic or de-identified data
- [ ] Implement secure data handling procedures
- [ ] No real patient information in code or models
- [ ] Clear disclaimer about demo/research purpose

### Bias & Fairness
- [ ] Test for demographic bias in screening decisions
- [ ] Evaluate performance across different patient populations
- [ ] Document known limitations and biases
- [ ] Include fairness metrics in evaluation

### Regulatory Awareness
- [ ] Add disclaimers about regulatory approval requirements
- [ ] Document that system is for research/demo purposes
