# Clinical Trial Screening AI - TODO

This file outlines the next steps for the new AI agent taking over the project.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1.  **‚úÖ RESOLVED Virtual Environment Issue:** Successfully created virtual environment at `~/venvs/clinical-trial-ai/` to bypass PEP 668 filesystem restrictions.
2.  **‚úÖ RESOLVED Dependencies Installation:** Successfully installed core packages: PyTorch 2.8.0, Transformers 4.56.0, Gradio 5.44.1, Pandas 2.3.2, NumPy 2.3.2.

## Current Status: READY FOR DEVELOPMENT üöÄ

**Virtual Environment:** `~/venvs/clinical-trial-ai/`  
**Activation Command:** `source ~/venvs/clinical-trial-ai/bin/activate`  
**Activation Script:** `./activate_env.sh`

## Next Development Steps

**FOR THE NEXT AI AGENT**: The project is ready for complete implementation. Follow these guides in order:

### üöÄ For Immediate Action (45 minutes):
1. **Read `QUICK_START.md`** - Essential steps for immediate execution
2. **Follow `AI_AGENT_TASKS.md`** - Detailed task-by-task breakdown  
3. **Reference `EXECUTION_GUIDE.md`** - Complete implementation details

### üéØ Critical Actions Required:
1. **Complete `clinical_trial_classifier.py`** - Current file is incomplete, needs full implementation
2. **Complete `app.py`** - Current file is incomplete, needs full implementation  
3. **Create test scripts** - `test_system.py` and `run_complete_demo.py`
4. **Install additional packages** - scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
5. **Run final verification** - All components must work together

### üìÅ Implementation Files Provided:
- `EXECUTION_GUIDE.md` - 70-step complete implementation guide
- `QUICK_START.md` - 6-step immediate execution guide  
- `AI_AGENT_TASKS.md` - Detailed task breakdown for smaller models
- Core files (incomplete, need replacement): `clinical_trial_classifier.py`, `app.py`

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**: Web interface functional at http://localhost:7860 with complete clinical trial screening capabilities.
